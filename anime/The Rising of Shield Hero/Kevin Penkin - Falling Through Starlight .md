As I move
Through the air
I hear the call to freedom
For the pain endured
Belongs to me

As I break the ocean skin and i rise from darkness
I see your eyes
I see your eyes

As I learn to breakaway from the rage screaming inside
I'm reborn
You're reborn

As I fly through cloudy skies on the backs of gods
And at the most stardust
Transcends my body and soul
To set me free

Falling through starlight with youï»¿
