<h3> Living every day</h3>
날마다 삶을 살아

**<h4>As if I won't wake up again</h4>**
다시는
<br>

**<h4>Cutting to the bone<h4>**
뼈를 깎아

**<h3> Just to relive us one last time</h3>**
마지막으로 우리를 한번 안심
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Through my execution
I bleed right from the core
Betrayal of the closest conscience
I'll forever know

Sitting in a cold illusion of my reality
Crashing through the burning darkness
All but consuming me
Carving out my soul
On to the wastelands of my dreams
How the hell do humans
Have the strength to carry on
