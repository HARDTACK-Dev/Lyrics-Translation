*Composer : Kevin Penkin <br>*

Living every day
As if I won't wake up again
Cutting to the bone
Just to relive us one last time
Through my execution
I bleed right from the core
Betrayal of the closest conscience
I'll forever know

Sitting in a cold illusion of my reality
Crashing through the burning darkness
All but consuming me
Carving out my soul
On to the wastelands of my dreams
How the hell do humans
Have the strength to carry on
